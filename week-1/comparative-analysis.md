## 🎯 Objective  
The study contrasts our suggested application, TalaTalk, which is specifically designed for public school communication in the Philippines, with three popular communication platforms: Remind, ClassDojo, and Messenger. The comparison draws attention to variations in features, accessibility, usability, and local context relevance. TalaTalk's teacher-first, low-bandwidth, culturally-aligned design aims to address communication gaps in PH public schools.
